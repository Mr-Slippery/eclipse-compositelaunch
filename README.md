Composite launch configurations for Eclipse

Composite launch configurations group existing launch configurations of other kinds 
and can be used to launch them all at once, each with its corresponding launch mode (Run/Debug/etc.)

Project was started as a homework task part of the hiring process with http://www.xored.com/

Thanks Ruslan for the interesting idea and fun interview! They've also been cool with me publishing it :-)
